###South Asian Fuel Price Visualisation

This repository has the pages, data and sources for a [visualisation of fuel prices](http://www.wionews.com/business-economy/why-are-indian-prices-not-falling-in-line-with-global-crude-oil-prices-11150) created for the Indian news channel WION.

The prices for Indian diesel and petrol, as well as the Indian Basket crude oil benchmark are taken from the Indian government body [Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell](http://ppac.org.in/content/149_1_PricesPetroleum.aspx).

The world crude oil consumption and production figures used in the second visualisation are from the US [Energy Information Administration](http://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/global_oil.cfm
).

The petrol and diesel prices for Pakistan are from the [Pakistan State Oil Company](http://www.psopk.com/en/product-and-services/product-prices/pol/pol-archives
).

The petrol and diesel prices for Nepal are from the [Nepal Oil Corporation](http://www.nepaloil.com.np/selling-price-archive-16.html
).

The prices for Sri Lanka are from the [Ceylon Petroleum Corporation](http://www.ceypetco.gov.lk/History.htm).

The break-up of diesel prices in Pakistan and India are from a Pakistan State Oil [notification](http://www.psopk.com/files/hsd/hsd_notifications_1117.pdf
) and the website of India's [Hindustan Petroleum](http://www.hindustanpetroleum.com/documents/pdf/pb/pricebuildup_Diesel.pdf
).

Some other odds and ends:

1) Exchange rates used for 1 US dollar is 104.78 Pakistani rupees, 68.13 Indian rupees, 150.49 Sri Lankan rupees and 109.17 Nepalese rupees.

2) The revised prices in India for diesel and petrol in January 2017 have been used for December 2016 for a more up-to-date comparison with other South Asian countries.

3) The quarters used in the world oil production and consumption chart are done according to the US system, so the quarter Q1 2014 is Jan-Mar 2014 and not Apr-Jun 2013 as it would be interpreted in South Asia.
